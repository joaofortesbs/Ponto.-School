# Ponto. School

## Overview
Ponto. School is an AI-powered educational platform designed to provide personalized learning experiences and streamline educational workflows for students and teachers. Its core purpose is to enhance educational engagement and efficiency through features like an AI assistant (Epictus), study groups, digital notebooks, smart worksheets, interactive quizzes, and automated lesson planning ("School Power").

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a modern design with glass-morphism effects, blur backgrounds, a defined color scheme (Primary Orange, Secondary Blue, Dark Navy text), custom responsive typography, and smooth CSS animations. It adopts a mobile-first approach and includes accessibility features like presentation mode with multi-language translation, dynamic font sizing, and voice reading support. The School Power Chat Interface uses custom avatar components and ultra-modern glassmorphism designs for interactive cards.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui, and Zustand for state management.
- **Backend**: Express.js for API endpoints.
- **AI Integration - LLM Orchestrator v3.0 Enterprise**: A unified, resilient multi-model cascade system providing a scalable and protected approach to AI content generation using a 5-tier architecture with 10 models. It includes circuit breakers, rate limiters, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, input sanitization, smart routing, and an in-memory cache system.
- **Authentication & User Management**: Supabase handles authentication, user sessions, role-based access, and profiles.
- **Core Features**:
    - **School Power**: AI-powered lesson planning managed by a robust, observable, and self-correcting Multi-Agent Lesson Orchestrator (v4.0) through a 7-step workflow.
    - **Agente Jota Chat Interface**: A chat-based interface for School Power featuring an orchestrator, planner, executor, a 3-layer memory manager, and a 4-layer Anti-Hallucination System, Rules Engine, Debug System, and Context-aware Content Generation.
    - **Multi-Turn Conversation System**: Enables unlimited consecutive plan executions within the same chat session.
    - **3-Call Context Architecture**: A unified context management system with specialized AI calls for initial response, development card reflections, and final response generation.
    - **API-First Architecture (V2)**: Uses standardized contracts and a central `CapabilityExecutor` for managing execution, validation, and context enrichment across `pesquisar`, `decidir`, `gerar`, `criar`, and `salvar` capabilities.
    - **Database Persistence Pipeline**: The `salvar_atividades_bd` capability persists created activities to the Neon database through a 4-phase architecture: COLLECT, VALIDATE, PERSIST, and VERIFY.
    - **Content Generation Pipeline (V2)**: The `gerar_conteudo_atividades` capability generates AI content for selected activities.
    - **Activity Creation Pipeline (V2)**: The `criar_atividade` capability persists generated activity fields to the database and emits events for UI updates.
    - **Field Synchronization System**: Provides bidirectional mapping between AI-generated and form field names.
    - **Auto-Build System with ModalBridge**: An event-driven architecture orchestrates the build process, managing progressive visual construction of activities within the `EditActivityModal`.
    - **StorageSyncService v2.0**: A centralized service for managing activity storage, tracking origin and pipeline metadata, and emitting events for UI synchronization.
    - **StorageOrchestrator Enterprise System**: A 3-layer storage architecture utilizing IndexedDB, Zustand/Memory cache, and localStorage to prevent `QuotaExceededError`. It features automatic layer selection, garbage collection, emergency cleanup, and global guards.
    - **Activity Version System**: Dual-version system categorizing activities into Interactive and Text Version for various activity types, with robust AI response parsing and professional 6-section fallback content generation.
    - **Lista de Exercícios Blindagem System v2.1.2**: Enterprise-grade isolation and protection system with a Bounded Context Architecture, protected files, contracts, a sanitizer, dedicated storage namespace, a 6-layer pipeline, and specific rules for modifications. It includes schema-aware JSON extraction and rigorous validation.
    - **Flash Cards Blindagem System**: Enterprise-grade isolation and protection system with a Bounded Context Architecture, protected files, contracts, a sanitizer, dedicated storage namespace, and specific rules for modifications.
    - **Study Groups**: Real-time chat and member management.
    - **Digital Notebooks & Smart Worksheets**: AI-integrated content generation.
    - **Daily Login System**: Gamified streaks and rewards.
    - **School Points**: Persisted and synchronized point system.
    - **Calendário School**: Comprehensive calendar event management.
    - **Lesson Publishing System**: Manages lesson publication.

### System Design Choices
The architecture emphasizes a modular component design based on shadcn/ui patterns. Data persistence uses Neon PostgreSQL for primary data, Supabase PostgreSQL for authentication, and Supabase Storage for file assets. Supabase Realtime supports live features. The system is designed for VM deployment to maintain backend state and real-time database connections, with dynamic section synchronization and isolated lesson creation sessions.
