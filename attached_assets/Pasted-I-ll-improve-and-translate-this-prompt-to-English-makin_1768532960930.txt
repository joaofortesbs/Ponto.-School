I'll improve and translate this prompt to English, making it more technical and complete while maintaining the original logic and structure:

CRITICAL ISSUE: Activities within the Construction Interface card are not being properly built.

Core Problem:
Activities must be constructed through the Edit Activities modal to ensure all field content within the modal is properly utilized for activity content generation. Currently, the system is not following this essential workflow.

System Architecture Clarification:

The implementation consists of three distinct, independent systems that must work in isolation while complementing each other sequentially:

Content Generation System

Purpose: Exclusive, individual configuration system dedicated to generating content for respective fields

Scope: Isolated content creation functionality

Input: Field specifications and parameters

Output: Generated content for each designated field

Edit Activities Modal System

Purpose: Serves as the dedicated activity builder and content repository

Functionality: Stores all field contents within their respective fields

Role: Acts as an isolated, self-contained activity constructor

Responsibility: Maintains complete activity data structure

Activity Creation/Activation System

Purpose: Integration layer for activating existing functionalities and system calls

Functionality: Directly triggers the "Generate Activities" button within each Edit Activities modal

Scope: Handles activation for each activity within the Construction Interface card

Role: Orchestration and invocation layer, not construction layer

Critical Design Principle:
These systems do NOT need to operate within a single continuous activation flow, but they MUST function independently and reliably, as each stage completes the next in sequence.

Outstanding Issues Requiring Resolution:

Issue #1: Progress Bar Functionality

Location: Construction Interface card

Current State: Non-functional or inaccurate

Required Behavior: Must be truly progressive, updating in real-time as activities within the card are successfully generated

Expected Result: Accurate visual representation of completion status

Issue #2: Debug Output Lacks Verification

Location: Activity Creation capability debug logs

Current Behavior: Shows "Finalizing" and "Completion" messages for each activity WITHOUT specific confirmation that:

The respective Edit Activities modal was actually accessed

The modal's internal "Generate" button was properly triggered

The construction process completed successfully with real confirmation

Problem: System appears to be simulating construction without performing actual, verifiable operations

CRITICAL: No real confirmation or validation of successful execution is occurring

Issue #3: Visual Identity and State Representation

Location: Construction Interface card (visible UI only, not internal activity state)

Current State: Activities show incorrect visual states

Required Implementation:

Initial State: All activities must display with "inactive" design style

Post-Creation State: Activities transition to "completed" design style only after successful generation

Scope: Visual changes apply ONLY to the visible Construction Interface card, NOT to internal activity components

REQUIRED: Complete Micro-Step Implementation Plan

Please provide a comprehensive, intelligently ordered micro-step plan that includes:

Analysis Phase

System dependency mapping

Current state assessment

Architecture verification points

Implementation Phase (in logical execution order)

Step-by-step modifications for each identified issue

Integration points between systems

State management updates

UI/UX visual state transitions

Verification Phase

Unit tests for each independent system

Integration tests for system handoffs

Debug logging enhancements for real confirmation

Progress bar accuracy validation

Visual state transition testing

Validation Phase

End-to-end workflow testing

Edge case scenarios

Rollback procedures if failures occur

Success Criteria:

Edit Activities modal is properly invoked for each activity

Real confirmation of button activation within modals

Progress bar accurately reflects actual completion

Visual states correctly represent activity status

Debug logs provide verifiable execution confirmation

All three systems operate independently without false positives

Please structure the plan with clear, actionable micro-steps that ensure correct implementation and thorough validation at each stage.
